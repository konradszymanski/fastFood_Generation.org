Style the placeOrder.html page - nest the form in a table for better presentation

Style the HTML table output by the /view code ... add grid lines to make separate orders clear

Add a css class corresponding to the 'state' of orders and use them to set the background colour of the order state table cell
Ordered-red, cooked-orange, served-yellow, paid-green

Extentsion tasks:-
For clarity - these are OPTIONAL - ideas for extending this exercise into a portfolio piece ... something to show potential employers
You won't have all the skills yet - but you can revisit this project as your skills grow - and refactor/improve as you see fit.
1) (without Javascript) Add some basic input validation on the order page :-
BIG clue https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_number.asp
2) Convert the view endpoint (/view in app.js) to output an HTML table of orders
You will need to convert the orderHTML to output a valid HTML table row
Use the backtick `${variable}` (template literals) syntax if you like (it does make things tidier)
3) Add a css class corresponding to the 'state' of orders and use them to set the background colour of the order state table cell
Ordered-red, cooked-orange, served-yellow, paid-green
3.5) Make the PlaceOrder page 'mobile friendly'  - increase the size of the arrows (or find another solution)
4) When you place an order - display your (the customers)  position in the queue (not quite as easy as it might sound)
5) Use a <thead> tag to lock the header rows of the orders table
https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_thead.asp
6) What happens if I use my browser back button and press  'Place order' (again) ?
Or if my Internet connection is flaky and I hit place order 6 times
Implement some form of idempotency token.
7) Render a meta refresh tag into the response - to have the 'order accepted/Position in queue 'page' continuously update
(This won't work .. in fact, I think it might be disastrous - but how could you make it work ?)
8) When I use a filter parameter http://localhost:3000/view?filter=ordered - and set an order to a new state - the list becomes unfiltered again - Task: - maintain the filter
9) Define some 'roles' (customer, chef, waitress, manager) and assign some (one or more) rights 'markCooked' 'markServed, 'markPaid'
9) More ideas:-
Add prices to the dishes
Make the menu (placeOrded.html) 'dynamic' (generated by the server)
Create bills/price the orders
Create a logon screen with a username/password
Create and maintain an audit trail of all actions, who did what, when
Add a screen to view the audit trail
Create a UI to edit the menu/create new dishes
Allow paid orders to be archived
Add dates/times to the orders
Split drinks orders from food orders and provide a screen for the barman
Produce a management dashboard - showing
	Average cooking time
	Average wait time (ordered->served)
	Daily turnover - perhaps as a bar chart - over the last 30 days (edite
